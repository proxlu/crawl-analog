# crawl-analog
Makes the W, A, S, and D keys simulate an analog stick in the game DCSS (Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup) on Linux, allowing for diagonal movements with key combinations. Additionally, the character's movement becomes more precise as well.

## How to Use

**1.** Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/proxlu/crawl-analog.git
```

**2.** Open the game, press 2x **~**, and remap **W**, **A**, **S**, and **D** keys to **]**: (This disables the default functions of these keys)

**3.** Run **crawl-analog.py**:

```
python3 crawl-analog.py
```
